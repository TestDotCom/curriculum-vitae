//== Managing a homelab

//In my free time I manage a self-hosted homelab over a Raspberry Pi (RPi). To keep things relatively simple, it's a *Docker Compose* file of several services, such as the media server.
//SSH'ing into the homelab is only possible via public key authentication, and a firewall (firewalld) is in place to restrict access only from the local VLAN.
